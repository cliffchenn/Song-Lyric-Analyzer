# Song-Lyric-Analyzer
An insightful tool that compares a song's diction against its popularity 

## What Does it Do
It scrapes the Genius website for lyrics and analyzes them using various Natural Language Processing (NLP). A song's sentiment indexe is compared against the number of streams on Spotify to derive a relationship between diction and popularity. Word clouds are also used to visualize each artist's choice of diction.

## What Information is Required
Any song of your choice! This includes the link to the genius lyrics page, length of the song, artist, and the number of Spotify streams. 

## Current Limitations 
Once you have chosen the songs you would like to analyze, the required information must be entered manually. This means analyzing many songs would take a while. 

## Next Steps 
Future plans to improve this tool include a search option to automate the retrieval of the required information, rmeoving the need for heavy manual input.
